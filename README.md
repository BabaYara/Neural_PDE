# Neural PDE

A package for experimenting with different solution techniques for SDE using physics-informed neural networks techniques.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

See the notebooks in `examples/` for how to build and train a simple model.

Modular loss suite supports Malliavin, Stein, Signature regularisation; see `examples/01_single_tree.ipynb`.
